## Kevin Lin
Hi, I'm Kevin--a software engineer on the Delivery and Distribution team at Insider Inc. Previously attended Stony Brook University where I got a degree in Biomedical Engineering and went to Fullstack Academy of code right after to pursue my passion in software. I primarily work with Golang, Node/Typescript, Docker + Kubernetes, Jenkins, and MongoDB. I geek out on basketball, wings (Buffalo Wild Wings ❤️), and body building.

### Goals 🏆
- [ ] Finish reading these Golang textbooks I have sitting around
- [ ] Learn how to sing decently
- [x] Build a production-ready application
- [ ] Learn about github actions to automate testing 
- [ ] Learn how to use minikube 
- [x] Hit a 1k total 

### Ask me about 💬
- The stray cat that always watches me workout 
- The best sauce combo for Buffalo Wild Wings 🤫
- My bootcamp experience 
- Tips for lifting 💪
